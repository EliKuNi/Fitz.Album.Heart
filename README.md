# Fitz.Album.Heart
Saw Fitz and The Tantrums´ "More Than Just A Dream" album art and thought, why not? So here´s their heart, coded in Python Turtle. 

p.s. Note that if you wish to use this code and change the background picture, you will need to add your own one from your computer, as the one that is by default will not be recognized by your pc. 

According to https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.bgpic , the background picture must be a GIF. PNG is not supported.
